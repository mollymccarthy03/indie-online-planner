# Molly McCarthy Online Homework Planner
## Problem Statement
Throughout my academic career, I have kept a planner and a notebook to document my homework assignments, when they are due and details about them. I have a specific planner I enjoy and a specific way I write my assignments. I have found that most of this is fairly time-consuming, as I spend time writing down my assignments, logging them in a calender and checking them off when they are finished. I have tried different online planners, like Notion and Google Calender, and none have worked the same as me writing down my assignments in my physical books. I want to create the perfect online planner for me to use for the rest of my academic career.
